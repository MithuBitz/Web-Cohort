# Web-Cohort by Great Hitesh Sir and Piyush Sir

## 01-FEB-25 : Intro to Javascript

- Hitesh sir explain what is JS with help of a factory model which is the best way to learn JS
- Function means factory and calling the function is like the manager work to run the function.

## 01-FEB-25 : Deep into the JS

- JS mainly have two parts one is datatype and other is processing. Where processing is the way how to process the data and datatype is how the data will store. Processing also have the conditional and loop.
- let and const make space in memory. Where in let value can be changed and in const value cannot be changed.
- null : To know the null we need to think about tempreture. Because in tempreture 0 is also a value. So in that case initially we need to define tepreture value to null, which represent we assign a space in memory for tempreture but intially it will be null or say no value.
- undefined : It is like "Jaga tou hai par khali hai abhi baad me bhara jayega data"
- Primitive and non-premitive data type.
- Use typeof in console to check the data type of a variable.
- Confusing situation in JS : object ka type bhi object hai and null ka bhi object type hai.
- JS is a Object oriented programming.
- In JS variable are very powerfull and it can store anything.
- Condition - If else
- Greedy algorithm : Greedy algorithms work well for problems where making the best choice at each step leads to the overall optimal solution, but may not be suitable for problems where future decisions might significantly impact the outcome. In greedy algorithm when get a first result then it exits.
- Array and its methods :
- Loop : for loop, while loop, forEach loop.

## Some terms mentions by the Gurujis

- Scaleing - It is used in production. It is the process of increasing the output of a product from a small-scale production run to a large-scale production run. This can be a challenging process, as it requires careful planning and execution to avoid delays, cost overruns and quality issues.
